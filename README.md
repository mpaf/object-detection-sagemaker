# object-detection-sagemaker

This sample workshop is based on https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_birds/object_detection_birds.html .

The notebooks in this workshop should be run using the **Python 3 (MXNet 1.8 Python 3.7 CPU Optimized)**. This kernel already includes a couple of needed libraries (MXNET, OpenCV) for image manipulation and packing images into RecordIO data records. A list of available SageMaker Studio pre-baked Kernels can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-available-kernels.html .

Please start the workshop at [Notebook 1](01-data%20preparation.ipynb)
